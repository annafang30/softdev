## K18: (Python+SQLite)3: A Mare Widge Made in Hebben
### SoftDev
### 25-10-2022
### time spent: TBD
<br>
###DISCO:
- While `DB_FILE="discobandit.db` used to work in older versions of sqlite, the current (most recent version) uses `DB_FILE="discobandit"`
- `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` allows us to create a table if it doen't already exist
- db allows you to use the cursor to trigger db events
- column name is determined automatically as the values of the first row
- Printing reading only returns an address
-  DictReader not subscriptable

<br>
###QCC:
- how do we handle repetition? How can we loop through DictReader multiple times without running into errors?
