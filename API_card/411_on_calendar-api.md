# Calendar API
---
## Provides:
Ways to integrate the user's app with google calendars using HTTP calls or through the Google client libraries.
It also shows all of the interfaces that are available with google calendars.

### Pain factor: 2/10(??) (the methods are pretty straight-forward - they mostly consist of explict calls like delete, get, insert, etc and the documentation is clear on what effects each method has on the code)

### Key Provisioning:
multiple authorization scope levels
  - once you register your application using the calendar API, you define the authorization scopes granted for use.
    - registered access credentials are authenticated for access and resource requests (asks for user consent)
    - using user login/password and pre-created credentials in app code, the access token is provided

### Quotas:
#### FOR PAID ACCOUNTS (info we found on the documentation - we could not determine how long a "short period" was)
  - "100,000 events during a short period"
  - "60 calendars in a short period"
  - "10,000 invites to people outside of their primary or secondary domain in a short period"
  - "2,000 emails to external guests "
  - "750 shares during a short period"

## The Good:
  - documentation for API methods are clear and concise
  - multiple levels of authentication for access to the API key
  -

## The Bad:
  - hard to find information (without testing quota limit handling) for free accounts (without paying $60/100)
  - certain actions like push notifications fill up quotas very quickly.

## The Ugly:
  - N/A (hard to determine the failings of the API without using it first)
