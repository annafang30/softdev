Notes
- making sure to check file names and source calls helps (a lot)
- requestID acts as a "grouper" 
- the window.requestAnimationFrame() call can go either before or after the code block
- speeding up due to the recursion loop (creates multi loops without closing the first loop)

Questions 
- N/A
