# DISCO:
predictions: 
q0: it will not run the render templates, but it will run everything that does not require the use of templates (ex: return "no hablo queso!")
q1: we predict that the url for the site will be http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template
q2: foo is the title of the site and collection is the output that the site displays

# QCC:
