# DISCO:
predictions: <br> 
q0: it will not run the render templates, but it will run everything that does not require the use of templates (ex: return "no hablo queso!") <br>
q1: we predict that the url for the site will be http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template <br>
q2: foo is the title of the site and collection is the output that the site displays

<br>

# QCC:
* Why does this list display the elements within it with new lines?
* what is endfor? Why are there % signs surrounding it?
