Notes
- events in 1 create a table and each click on the cells creates a popup 
- calling tr in 2 displays all the elements in the row after the individual cell is called to alert  
- after running the addEventListener with the boolean in 3, the behavior of 2 and 3 changes 
    - two begins to display the inner html of the full table after displaying the row
