 K28 -- Getting more comfortable with the dev console and the DOM
 2023-04-16
--------------------------------------------------
Notes 
- console.log() sends a print call in the web console
- pressing enter in the web console displays all log function at the bottom of the screen
- console.log(myFxn) returns the body of the const
- Ctrt+Shift/Option+J will allow you to run JS in the browser!
- JS DOM allows for manipulation of HTML documents
- DOM provides functions to edit parts of the functions/documents 

Questions 
-  How can we employ the const myFxn? Can other functions envoke it?
- Is there a better way to call the javascript functions in order to implement them into html other than declaring each individual section? 
- what are the downsides to using things like document.write(), etc?
